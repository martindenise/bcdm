        <h1>The Best Bartending School Around</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Bartending School</b> is a practical, affordable and fast-track method of landing a high-paying job as a Bartender. Bartending is a high paying, flexible, and most of all FUN job - if you can even call it a job! Obtaining proper training
            is absolutely necessary if you want to to successfully break into this lucrative industry without having to work your way up from the bottom (can you say bussing tables...). At the Bartending College Bartending Schools we have the experience,
            pro instructors and industry connections to get you into the bartending job you 've been looking for. The Bar & Restaurant industry is one of the few job markets that's seeing growth these days. In fact it made the US News list of the "20
            Industries Where Jobs Are Coming Back", adding nearly 150,000 new jobs in 2010 alone. Isn 't it time to give Bartending School a serious look?
